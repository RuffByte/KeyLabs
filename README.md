# KeyLabs

This repository hosts the in progress codebase for [KeyLabs](https://github.com/tulza/KeyLabs) V2! KeyLabs is an online game inspired by typing tests such as [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) and [TypeRacer](https://play.typeracer.com/) and aiming games such as [AimLabs](https://aimlabs.com/) and [Aimbooster](https://www.aimbooster.com/). Originally KeyLabs was developed during the Terrible Ideas Hackathon, where we managed to score second place, however due to the lack of time, some features were unpolished / uncompleted and needed major refactoring. Hence KeyLabs V2.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
